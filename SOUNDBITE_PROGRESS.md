# SoundBite — Development Progress

> **Purpose:** This is the living record of SoundBite's actual implementation status. Read it alongside `SOUNDBITE_CONTEXT.md` before planning or implementing work. Update it after every meaningful coding, testing, debugging, or planning session.
>
> **Accuracy rule:** Distinguish verified implementation from assumptions and planned work. Do not claim that code works, tests pass, or changes have been pushed unless that has been verified.

## 3. Feature Implementation Tracker

| Feature | Status | Evidence / notes |
|---|---|---|
| User registration and authentication | Partially verified — UI blocked | Registration, login by username/email, logout and current-user API checks passed against a temporary migrated database. `/register`, `/login` and `/account` load; registration and login form submissions have existing failures documented below. |
| User profiles | Implemented — verified | `ApplicationUser` stores a display name and bio; the account page can edit them, and `/users/{username}` displays the public profile without exposing account email. The migration and persistence round-trip are tested. |
| Music catalogue | In progress | `Artist`, `Album`, and `Track` models exist with validation and EF relationship wiring in `ApplicationDbContext.cs`. There is no catalog UI or metadata service implementation beyond the model layer. |
| Spotify integration | Not started | `Services/SpotifyCatalogService.cs` is empty and there is no client configuration or API integration yet. |
| Track ratings and reviews | Implemented — verified | Reviews persist through EF Core; the service supports create/read/update, the database enforces one review per user per track and valid 1–5 ratings, and track details support public review reading plus authenticated submission/editing. |
| Album-track many-to-many relationship | Implemented — unverified | `ApplicationDbContext` maps `ArtistAlbums` and `ArtistTracks` and `Track.AlbumId` with a nullable optional foreign key. This matches the intended design, but the schema has not been validated via a migration review beyond the code. |
| Playlist management | Implemented — verified | Users can create, edit, and delete playlists; add/remove tracks; and browse public playlist listings/details. Owner checks are enforced in the service. |
| Playlist duplicate prevention | Implemented — verified | Service validation and a unique database index on playlist and track prevent duplicates. Playlist item positions preserve order. |
| Following and followers | Not started | `Models/Follow.cs` is empty and no follow service or route has been implemented. |
| Likes and comments | Not started | `Models/Like.cs` and `Models/Comment.cs` are empty. No authorization or interaction logic is implemented. |
| Activity feed | Not started | `Models/ActivityItem.cs`, `Services/FeedService.cs`, and social service classes are still empty or incomplete. |
| Rankings and trends | Planned | `Services/RankingService.cs`, `Services/TrendService.cs`, `Strategies/PopularityRankingStrategy.cs`, and `Strategies/RatingRankingStrategy.cs` exist, but no implemented ranking logic is visible in the current code. |
| Administrative user management | Not started | `Services/AdminService.cs` is empty and there is no admin UI or authorization pattern beyond Identity setup. |
| Automated tests | Complete — verified | The NUnit test project passed: 144 tests succeeded, 0 failed, 0 skipped (2026-10-15). |
| Git and repository hygiene | Verified | `FixDuplicateRegisterRoute` starts at fetched `origin/main` (`1cd65a0`); route fix, regression tests and progress update are uncommitted. |

## 4. Latest Completed Work

### 2026-10-15 — Duplicate registration route fixed and verified

- Removed only `@page "/register"` from `SoundBite/Components/Pages/Account.razor`; the dedicated `Register.razor` owns `/register`, while Account retains `/login` and `/account`. No authentication logic changed.
- Added `SoundBite.Tests/PageRouteTests.cs`: scans compiled component route attributes for duplicate templates (case-insensitive, ignoring trailing slashes) and checks the owners of all three authentication routes. This detects duplicate declarations, not every possible overlap between parameterized route patterns.
- Regression proof: before the fix, 2 of the 4 new cases failed and explicitly identified Account and Register sharing `/register`; after the fix the full suite passed.
- `dotnet build SoundBite/SoundBite.csproj --nologo`: passed, 0 warnings/errors. `dotnet test SoundBite.Tests/SoundBite.Tests.csproj --nologo`: 144 passed, 0 failed/skipped. `git diff --check`: passed.
- Browser: `/register`, `/login`, `/account`, `/catalogue/search` all loaded without routing errors. Followed Register's Log in link successfully. Existing navigation targets Account, and review/playlist login links and account redirects remain valid; no link changes required.
- Used a fresh SQLite database at `/tmp/soundbite-route-check.jPlMyn/test.db`, migrated through a temporary external console harness with `Database.MigrateAsync()` because `dotnet ef` was unavailable. Launched with an explicit `ConnectionStrings__DefaultConnection` override on localhost:5187. No application database migration was run.
- API checks against temporary data: registration 200, authenticated `/api/account/me` 200, logout 200, unauthenticated `/me` 401, username and email login 200. An invalid-password request was rejected (observed final HTTP 400 with automatic redirects enabled; not asserted as the endpoint's original status).
- Existing UI issues reproduced: Register submission displays “Unable to reach the server” (relative request URL with no HTTP client base address configured); valid Account login throws `InvalidOperationException: Headers are read-only, response has already started` when setting the cookie from the interactive circuit. These are separate from route resolution and were left unchanged under this task's authentication scope boundary.
- Existing `SoundBite/soundbite.db` SHA-256 before/after: `ead1d21ea950e99cd6548f23d0b83159ac69c24b2bd4cbbf2dcac8376159eeaf`. Checkout was initially clean; only the three requested implementation/documentation files changed. No commit, push or merge performed.

### 2026-10-15 — Playlist persistence and management implemented

- **Task completed:** Added playlists owned by Identity users, ordered playlist tracks, public listing/details, and owner-only playlist and track management.
- **Files or components changed:** Playlist models, EF mappings and `PlaylistService`; `/playlists` and `/playlists/{id}` pages; navigation; `AddPlaylists` migration and model snapshot; `PlaylistServiceTests.cs`.
- **Important implementation decisions:** Playlists are public by default. Only owners can create, edit, delete, or change tracks. A unique database index prevents duplicate tracks in a playlist; deleting a playlist cascades to its items, not to tracks.
- **Verification performed and its result:** Full NUnit suite passed: 128/128. Focused playlist tests passed: 9/9, covering persistence, visibility, ownership, CRUD, ordering, and duplicate prevention.
- **Remaining limitations:** The configured application database was not migrated during this session. Browser-based playlist interaction has not been manually tested.

### 2026-10-15 — Public and editable user profiles implemented

- **Task completed:** Added profile data, profile editing for the signed-in user, and a public profile route.
- **Files or components changed:** `SoundBite/Data/ApplicationUser.cs`, `SoundBite/Components/Pages/Account.razor`, `SoundBite/Components/Pages/UserProfile.razor`, the EF migration and model snapshot, and `SoundBite.Tests/CataloguePersistenceTests.cs`.
- **Important implementation decisions:** Kept profile fields on the Identity user for the smallest coherent implementation. Public profile pages show display name, username, and optional bio, not email. The migration supplies an empty display-name default so existing accounts remain compatible.
- **Verification performed and its result:** `dotnet test SoundBite.Tests/SoundBite.Tests.csproj -v minimal` passed: 116/116. The focused migration/persistence tests passed: 20/20.
- **Remaining limitations:** Apply the new migration to the app's configured database before using profile editing (`dotnet ef database update --project SoundBite/SoundBite.csproj --startup-project SoundBite/SoundBite.csproj`). No profile image, profile activity, or social follow functionality is included. The page was compile-validated but not manually exercised in a browser.

### 2026-10-15 — Account authentication flow implemented

- **Task completed:** Added a working interactive account page and endpoint support for registration, sign-in, sign-out, and current-user lookup.
- **Files or components changed:** `SoundBite/Endpoints/AccountEndpoints.cs`, `SoundBite/Components/Layout/NavMenu.razor`, and `SoundBite/Components/Pages/Account.razor`.
- **Important implementation decisions:** The fastest path to a working product is to make the account workflow usable in-browser immediately instead of only exposing a bare API endpoint. The account screen now supports registration, login, and logout and shows the signed-in user details.
- **Verification performed and its result:** Ran `dotnet test SoundBite.Tests/SoundBite.Tests.csproj -v minimal`; result: `115/115` tests passed successfully.
- **Remaining limitations:** At that point, there was no editable profile or public profile page; both have since been added.

### 2026-10-15 — Earlier review branch discrepancy resolved

- **Task status:** An earlier checkpoint found that review changes were missing from the `Authentication` branch at that time. The review feature has since been implemented and is present in the current branch.
- **Current evidence:** Reviews are EF-backed, have a persistence migration and tests, and are available from the track detail workflow.
- **Action:** The current feature tracker reflects the implementation; the earlier checkpoint is retained only as historical context.

### 2026-10-15 — Repository baseline verification and progress update

- **Task completed:** Verified the current configuration, test state, startup state, and project structure against the repository.
- **Files or components changed:** `SOUNDBITE_PROGRESS.md` was updated to reflect the repository state; no application code was changed during this verification session.
- **Important implementation decisions:** The project is confirmed to be a starter scaffold rather than a fully implemented social music application. Identity + SQLite + EF Core are established, but most domain features remain stubs.
- **Verification performed and its result:** Ran `dotnet test SoundBite.Tests/SoundBite.Tests.csproj -v minimal`; result: 70/70 tests passed. Ran `dotnet run --project SoundBite --urls http://localhost:5080`; result: application started successfully and reported `Now listening on: http://localhost:5080` and `Application started.`
- **Remaining limitations:** No end-to-end authentication flow, catalogue UI, playlist logic, or social interaction workflow was validated beyond compile/startup and test execution.

## 5. Current Implementation Details

- The application entry point in `SoundBite/Program.cs` configures a Blazor Web App with `AddRazorComponents().AddInteractiveServerComponents()`, SQLite via `UseSqlite(...)`, and ASP.NET Core Identity via `AddIdentityCore<ApplicationUser>()` and `AddEntityFrameworkStores<ApplicationDbContext>()`.
- `SoundBite/Data/ApplicationDbContext.cs` defines the main EF entities: `Artists`, `Albums`, and `Tracks`, and uses many-to-many joins to model `ArtistAlbums` and `ArtistTracks`.
- `Track` has an optional `AlbumId`/`Album` relationship and uses validation attributes for required `Title` and optional non-whitespace `SpotifyId`.
- `Album`, `Artist`, and `Track` models initialize empty navigation collections and enforce basic validation requirements.
- `Endpoints/AccountEndpoints.cs` exposes registration, login, logout, and current-user endpoints.
- `Data/ApplicationUser.cs` includes `DisplayName` and optional `Bio`. The account page edits these fields; `/users/{username}` displays a public profile without exposing email.
- Most remaining model and service classes are placeholders: `Follow`, `Like`, `Comment`, `ActivityItem`, `SpotifyCatalogService`, `AdminService`, `FeedService`, `FollowService`, `SocialInteractionService`, `UserService`, and the ranking/trend services.
- The NUnit test project is active and passes, and the app builds and starts successfully.
- `20261015074342_AddUserProfiles` migrates the display-name and bio fields; the playlist migration adds playlists and ordered track items.

## 6. Important Decisions and Assumptions

- **Decision:** Keep the app in a scaffolded early stage while establishing core app infrastructure.
  - **Reason:** This is consistent with the repository evidence: Identity, EF Core, and core models are present, but the social product features remain unfinished.
  - **Impact:** Future work must build on the existing EF/Identity foundation rather than reworking the app structure.
  - **Status:** Confirmed

- **Decision:** Model the catalogue as `Artist`/`Album`/`Track` with EF many-to-many relationships and optional album assignment.
  - **Reason:** The relationship structure is explicit in `ApplicationDbContext` and aligns with the intended track/album requirements.
  - **Impact:** Future catalogue features can extend this model without changing the core schema pattern.
  - **Status:** Confirmed

- **Decision:** Keep the review/rating feature as a small, EF-backed domain model rather than an in-memory placeholder.
  - **Reason:** The review workflow is now represented in the data model and service layer, with database uniqueness and validation enforced through code and schema constraints.
  - **Impact:** Product requirements for user reviews can now be satisfied with a stable domain and test coverage, and future work can build on the same pattern for other social features.
  - **Status:** Confirmed

## 7. Known Issues and Blockers

| Issue | Impact | Evidence | Next action | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Registration form cannot reach endpoint | Dedicated registration submission fails | Browser message and unconfigured HttpClient base address | Repair request transport in a separate authentication task | Open |
| Interactive login cannot set cookie | Valid login terminates circuit | Server reports read-only response headers in Account.LoginAsync | Move cookie issuance to an HTTP request in a separate authentication task | Open |
| Social product features are not yet implemented | The app does not yet support the planned social discovery workflows | Empty follow, like, comment, and feed services/models | Implement follows and a basic activity feed | Open |
| Social persistence layer is missing | Follows, likes, comments, and feed features cannot be used reliably | Empty `Follow.cs`, `Like.cs`, `Comment.cs`, `ActivityItem.cs`, and related services | Design and implement the social model and service layer | Open |
| No Spotify client is configured | Music catalogue enrichment is not connected to external metadata | `SpotifyCatalogService.cs` is empty and no API client configuration exists | Add a service abstraction and integrate Spotify metadata access | Open |

## 8. Verification Record

| Check | Result | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Application build | Passed | `dotnet test SoundBite.Tests/SoundBite.Tests.csproj -v minimal` built the app and test project successfully. |
| Automated tests | Passed | 144 tests discovered and executed; 144 succeeded; 0 failed; 0 skipped. |
| Application startup | Passed | Command: `dotnet run --project SoundBite --urls http://localhost:5080` → app reported `Now listening on: http://localhost:5080` and `Application started.` |
| Relevant feature behaviour | Partially verified | All four requested routes loaded in-browser. API authentication passed against temporary data; registration/login form submission failures were reproduced (see latest work). |
| Database migrations | Passed | Profile, review, and playlist migrations are exercised by SQLite persistence tests, including playlist creation and CRUD against the migrated schema. |

## 9. Git Status

- **Active branch:** `FixDuplicateRegisterRoute`, created from latest fetched `origin/main`, `1cd65a04ca70b25181aa2666eb962136b57c980a`.
- **Initial checkout:** Clean on `CatalogueIntegrationFinal`; no local changes needed stashing.
- **Uncommitted changes:** `SoundBite/Components/Pages/Account.razor`, new `SoundBite.Tests/PageRouteTests.cs`, `SOUNDBITE_PROGRESS.md`.
- **Commit/push/merge:** None performed. Review the diff before authorizing publication.
- **Suggested commit title:** `Fix duplicate registration route and add route regression tests`
- **Suggested description:** Keep registration on its dedicated page, preserve login/account aliases, add duplicate-route and route-ownership checks, and document build, NUnit and isolated browser/API verification plus existing authentication UI blockers.

## 10. Next Recommended Tasks

1. **Task:** Implement follow/unfollow and a basic activity feed.
   - **Reason:** The application’s core differentiation is social discovery, and the current models/services are still empty.
   - **Dependencies:** Finalize the user, follow, like, comment, and activity schema.
   - **Acceptance criteria:** Users can follow others, like content, comment, and see feed activity without duplicate or invalid entries.

2. **Task:** Build the Spotify metadata abstraction and catalogue service.
   - **Reason:** The app requires external catalogue data and currently has no integration point.
   - **Dependencies:** Decide on a client configuration and service contract before wiring metadata retrieval.
   - **Acceptance criteria:** Metadata can be fetched and mapped into `Artist`, `Album`, and `Track` models without coupling the UI directly to Spotify APIs.

## 11. Handover for the Next Chat Session

- **What was accomplished:** Added persisted playlists and ordered items, public listing/details, owner-only management, duplicate prevention, an EF migration, and service tests.
- **What remains incomplete:** Follow relationships, likes/comments, activity feed, rankings/trends, Spotify integration, and profile activity.
- **Known errors or blockers:** No build or test failures remain. Browser-based playlist interaction and applying `AddPlaylists` to the configured application database are outstanding.
- **Most relevant files for the next task:** `SoundBite/Models/Follow.cs`, `SoundBite/Services/FollowService.cs`, and feed model/service placeholders.
- **Next recommended action:** Implement follow/unfollow and a basic activity feed.
- **Verification that remains outstanding:** Authentication UI requires the separately documented fixes; profile editing, review and playlist browser workflows remain unverified. Latest route and API checks are recorded in section 4.
